MusiCAL

MusiCAL is a collaborative final project, completed during our time at Northcoders.

Musical is a gig-finding calendar app, which,  when paired with the user’s Spotify account, ensures that they’ll never miss their favourite artists’ events again. Our app is unique for every user, and is built entirely around their listening preferences. 
 
To complement with the calendar, users can enjoy a range of additional features whilst they explore the app, such as personalised recommendations for their next big festival, and  customised poster designs, styled by their top bands

This app was created using Flutter and Dart, in under two weeks. 
This app will not function without the appropriate .env files installed on a local machine.
